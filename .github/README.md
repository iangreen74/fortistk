# FortiSTK: Distributed AI Security Research for DeFi

FortiSTK is an open, ongoing research project investigating the application of distributed artificial intelligence to security challenges within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.

Our objective is to design, prototype, and evolve intelligent agent-based systems capable of securing DeFi networks against fraud, exploitation, and systemic vulnerabilities. FortiSTK is not a static product. It is an active exploration into building antifragile, self-defending decentralized security architectures.

## Research Focus

**Primary Problems Under Investigation:**

### 1. Cross-Agent Data Synchronization

- DeFi environments generate heterogeneous data: smart contract events, transaction graphs, mempool signals, and off-chain metadata.
- Challenge: enabling autonomous AI agents to exchange and reason across disparate data types securely and in real-time.
- Current research directions:
  - Lightweight domain-specific serialization protocols.
  - Local-first data models with eventual consistency over blockchain-anchored states.
  - Efficient, authenticated gossip propagation techniques.

### 2. Mathematical Trust and Reputation Modeling

- Autonomous agents require models of "trust" to collaborate without centralized coordination.
- Current research directions:
  - Weighted EigenTrust-style reputation graphs.
  - Dynamic Bayesian trust updating based on behavioral observations.
  - Sybil-resistance through probabilistic trust clustering.

### 3. Real-Time DeFi Fraud Detection

- DeFi transaction flows are high-volume, high-velocity, and high-entropy.
- Challenge: identifying anomalies, flash loan attacks, phishing exploits, and draining events within sub-second timeframes.
- Current research directions:
  - Sparse attention models on transaction graphs.
  - Hybrid on-chain heuristics and lightweight ML classifiers.
  - Evolutionary learning methods for feature optimization without centralized training.

### 4. Antifragile System Design

- Building systems that strengthen under adversarial pressure.
- Inspiration drawn from biological immune systems, mycelial networks, and decentralized swarm behavior.
- Core design tenets: distributed consensus, adaptive learning, redundancy, and adversarial resilience.

## Current Technical Model (In Progress)

### Early Wallet Risk Score Function

Let:

- \( W \) = wallet address
- \( T(W) \) = transaction set associated with \( W \)
- \( f(T) \) = feature extraction functions (e.g., volume, velocity, counterparty entropy)
- \( R(W) \) = risk score for wallet \( W \)

We propose:

\[
R(W) = \sigma\left(\sum\_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i f_i(T(W))\right)
\]

Where:

- \( \sigma \) = sigmoid normalization function
- \( \alpha_i \) = weight coefficients optimized via evolutionary algorithms
- \( f_i \) = extracted features across historical transaction behavior

Wallet risk scoring forms the basis for agent-driven anomaly detection and cooperative fraud prevention.

## About the Project

FortiSTK is founded on the conviction that decentralized financial systems require decentralized security systems — intelligent, adaptive, and distributed.

We seek to contribute serious research to the emerging field of autonomous security for DeFi, informed by practical engineering, rigorous theoretical foundations, and real-world experimentation.
